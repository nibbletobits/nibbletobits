Program Design 
 
This is the Design that you would turn in
Step 1: Purpose of the code
Program will check if users input is a leap year or not
 
Step 2: Hand examples of calculation
formula : year/4=leap year
year/100 = not a leap year
year/400 = leap year
Year not divisible by 4 = not a leap year 
 
Step 3: Write the pseudo code (or a flowchart)
Ask for year input that is more than 1582
If less print does not meet requirements
If 1582 or greater run through algorithm 
 
Step 4: Declare the Input Variables and give type and range.
year= user input
Less than 1582 does not meet criteria
If year is divisible by 4 it is a leap year
If year is divisible by 4 but is also divisible by 100 then it is not
If year is divisible by 4 and 100 and also 400 than it is a leap year
If it is not divisible by 4 it is not a leap year
Step 5: 
********************************
def main():
year = int(input("input a Year that falls after 1582: "))
if year < 1582:
print("year does not meet criteria")
if year % 4 == 0:
if year % 100 == 0:
if year % 400 == 0:
print("is a leap year!")
print("Not a leap year!")
 
Step 6: Provide input variables and Output.
(year)
is/is not a leap year
 
Step 7: The code
